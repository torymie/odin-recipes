        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p>This Russian salad recipe is what my mom and grandmother make every time there's a family gathering 
            or a special occasion. Leave out the ham to make this a vegetarian dish. The potatoes, carrots, 
            and eggs do not have to be completely chilled after boiling.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>6 potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 carrot, or more to taste</li>
