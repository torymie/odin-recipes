        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap tortillas in foil.</li>
            <li>Bake wrapped tortillas in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium heat. 
                Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and jalapeño; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in beans and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. 
                Stir in cream cheese and salt; cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Stir in cilantro.</li>
            <li>Spoon filling in a line across the middle of each tortilla. 
                Fold opposing edges of the tortilla to overlap the filling. 
                Roll 1 of the opposing edges around the filling creating a burrito. Serve immediately.</li>
