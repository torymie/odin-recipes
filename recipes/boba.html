        <h1>Description</h1>

        <p>Boba tea, or bubble tea, is a popular drink that originated from Taiwan. 
            I made this coconut variation because I had coconut cream on hand and wanted something 
            different from the regular black milk tea variation. 
            This coconut version tastes just like the one you'll find in a bubble tea cafe.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>Tapioca pearls</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>7 cups cold water</li>
                <li>(8.8 ounce) package tapioca starch balls</li>
                <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            </ul></li>

            <li>Tea</li>
            <li><ul>
                <li>4 cups brewed black tea (such as Lipton®), chilled</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut cream</li>
                <li>12 ice cubes</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a large stockpot. Pour in tapioca and simmer for 25 minutes. 
                Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from heat and let balls sit in water for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return stockpot to the heat; simmer and stir for 25 minutes more. 
                Remove from heat and let rest again until centers of the balls are no longer powder, 
                another 25 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Combine brown sugar and white sugar in a large bowl. Pour tapioca balls into the sugar mixture. 
                Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes while preparing the tea.</li>
            <li>Process tea, coconut cream, ice, milk, and sugar together in a blender until combined.</li>
            <li>Scoop 1/4 cup of the tapioca into each tall glass and fill with tea. 
                Enjoy with large straws to suck up the tapioca, or use spoons.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cook's notes</h2>

        <p>For a more pronounced black tea taste, use Hong Kong-style tea bags. <br>
            Substitute half-and-half for the milk if desired.</p>
